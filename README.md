# Kick-off

A nice starting point for new apps, including some basic features and library
choices. Primary intended to speed up the development of new "prototype" style
apps.

## Notes on Mountain View

**Palette:** To add a colour to the palette, follow these steps:

* Add the variable name + value to `stylesheets/base/_colours.sass`
* Add the variable name to the sass list `$palette` in `stylesheets/static_styleguide/_palette.sass`
* Update the markup in `views/mountain_view/static/_palette.haml` accordingly

Not as slick as it should be, I knowâ€¦ I plan to streamline this in my Mountain View fork.
